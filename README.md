# Banker's Algorithm

This program is developed for the purpose of finding the safe sequence of processes by using the Banker's Algorithm

## Flow process of the program

1. Read input file
2. Obtain the values in the input file
3. Process the values by using the Banker's Algorithm to find the safe sequence

## Features

- Able to determine if the file has unbalanced or insufficient data
- Not limited to only 3 resources and 5 processes

## Limitations

This code is developed in one environment only. To avoid any compatibility issues, we decided to use an online compiler so that the environment will be standardised

- Requires to exactly follow the template provided (changes in the template will may cause the program to be unable to execute)
- Compatibility issues:
1. Different version of operating system
2. Online IDE 

## Editing the input file

- Separate all numbers by space (" ")
- Eliminate extra space at the end of each line
- Eliminate extra line at the end of the file

## Installation

1. Open this link [Replit](https://replit.com/join/cpectbkwdn-imranmohamad26)
2. Run the program
