# Banker's Algorithm

This program is developed for the purpose of finding the safe sequence of processes by using the Banker's Algorithm

## Flow process of the program

1. Read input file
2. Obtain the values in the input file
3. Process the values by using the Banker's Algorithm to find the safe sequence

## Features

- Able to determine if the file has unbalanced or insufficient data
- Not limited to 3 resources or 5 processes only

## Limitations

- This code is developed in one environment only. To avoid any compatibility issues, such as different Operating System or different compiler. we decided to use an online IDE so that the environment will be standardised.
- Requires to exactly follow the template provided (changes in the template will may cause the program to be unable to execute)

## Editing the input file

- Separate all numbers by space (" ")
- Eliminate extra space at the end of each line
- Eliminate extra line at the end of the file

## Executing the Program

1. Open the online IDE -> [Replit](https://replit.com/join/cpectbkwdn-imranmohamad26)
2. Run the program

the program will display the banker's algorithm table if all the process are satisifed with the conditions and thus display the safe sequence.
if not, the program will display '-1'

the program will terminate if the user enter '0'
